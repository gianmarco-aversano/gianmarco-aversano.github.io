After graduating in Energy Engineering with a Master Thesis in Machine Learning for numerical solvers of differential equations, I started working on my Doctoral Thesis, in which I applied Machine Learning to engineering problems from the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics. I am passionate about research, A.I. and programming.
